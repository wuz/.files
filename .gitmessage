# Footer



# Type should be one of the following:
# * Feat (new feature)
# * Fix (bug fix)
# * Doc (changes to documentation)
# * Style (change in code format, no logic change)
# * Refactor (refactoring production code)
# * Test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# * Chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# The first line should contain a type and a subject in the imperative tone.
#     i.e. [Feat]: Add dropdown list to contact select form.
# In the "Why" section, take a few lines to explain why this change was needed,
# what code the change effects, and any possible side effects of the change.
# Use the footer to add useful information like issue tracking id, signature (if working
# on an open source project, give a relevant identification), and any other relevant information
# about the project itself.
